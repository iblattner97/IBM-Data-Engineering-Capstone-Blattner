# IBM-Data-Engineering-Capstone---Blattner
Final code snippets, models, and queries from my capstone project through IBM's Data Engineering professional certificate on Coursera.

As a part of the Capstone project, I assumed the role of an Associate Data Engineer who had recently joined an e-commerce
organization. I was presented with a business challenge that required building a data platform for retailer data analytics.

In this Capstone project, I was tasked with the following:
- Design a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. 
- Design and implement a data warehouse and generate reports from the data.
- Design a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business.
- Extract data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline.
- Create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model.

The screenshots posted in my repository contain the step by step process of how I achieved each goal.

After submission and peer review, I was granted a passing grade of 100% on my project and earned my official certification.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
